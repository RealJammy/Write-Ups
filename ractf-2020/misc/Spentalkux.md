## Installing Spentalkux

From the Brief we can see it is a python package.
Downloading it and importing it gives the cipher text:
```
$ pip install spentalkux
$ python
>>> import spentulkux
Hello.
Can I help you?
Oh, you're looking for something to do with *that*.
My creator left this behind but, I wonder what the key is? I don't know, but if I did I would say it's about 10 characters.
Enjoy this.

Goodbye now.
That's your cue to leave, bro
Exit stage left, pal
OFF YOU POP.
You know what I haven't got time for this
Forking and executing rm -rf.
```

The code can be deciphered with a Vigenere cipher using the key: spentalkux

Then visit pastebin "https://pastebin.com/BCiT0sp6" and decode hex that forms an image

The image says to `look back into the past` which means the previous release of spentalkux

`pip install spentalkux==0.9`

It then gives another code

The rest can be done in cyberchef

From Base32 -> From Base64 -> Gunzip -> From Binary -> From Binary -> From Hex -> From Base85
